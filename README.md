# Bakr.io Bread Recognition Project

This project was coded using the Javalin framework utilising the java language to code within html and css.

I started by coding in c++ and realised shortly after I'd need to change to a model that would support web development.

I bought my ideas over to java and started to code up a simple interface using form data to get user input whilst delivering on the design brief. 

## Assumptions made

- I created separate webpages for every process and opted for the user to have more choice in mode selection.
- I default included the word bread to be highlighted at all times, even when the user had not put it in the list of words. I felt it was more inline with Bakr.io and can easily be disabled if not wanted.
- I used stock images utilised under creative commons for bread images.
- I only considered either . , ! or ? as end of sentence. 
- I left the HAS BREAD and DOESN'T HAVE BREAD in. However, these can be easily removed.

## How to run

Simply navigate over to App.java and hit the run button. This should work as long as you have java installed and in your PATH. From there you can click on the link that pops up or navigate to http://localhost:7000/ to see the website.
